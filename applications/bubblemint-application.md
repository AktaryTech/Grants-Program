# Mintbase Grant Proposal

![banner](./img/bubblemint_banner.png)

---

- **Project Name:** Bubblemint
- **Team Name:** AktaryTech
- **Payment Address:** shardeez.near
- **[Level](../README.md#level_slider-levels):** 3

## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

Bubblemint is a "lazy minting" or "candy machine" strategy that will be open-source asset for anyone wanting to launch a collection with Mintbase.io contracts.

The initial user will be our own NFT project, Shardeez. Subsequent users will be anyone with pre-generated assets and wants to use Mintbase contracts. These users will handle the upload and hosting of the assets and minting page. In subsequent milestones, Bubblemint tools will be extended into a no-code launchpad, which will make Mintbase a major source of large generative art projects.

### Overview

AktaryTech is a Web3 development service company. We normally build dApps for clients, including DeFi and NFT Marketplaces, but we wanted to create our own product as well and we started with Shardeez. We have an NFT artist on the team who does AI generation, and we chose NEAR as the ecosystem to grow with. So Shardeez are "Sharded Blocks", an homage to the sharded blockchain NEAR, which we believe can scale properly for the future.

#### Why Bubblemint?

Tagline: Gumball Machine Minting System for NEAR using Mintbase.io

We found that TenK DAO has a good open source "lazy minting" platform and forked it. It has a frontend site for the wallet connection and data on remaining NFTs to mint, and has different configurations based on whether your wallet is whitelisted and at what period of the mint.

We ran into issues getting it set up, including Apple M1 compatibility, whitelisting smart contract issues, UI to contract compatibility, and there are wallet mishaps under heavy use. But we got it working! All said, we gained familiarity with the frontend and their TypeScript / Rust smart contracts. Which gave us the confidence to remake it.

Mintbase.io is the perfect technology for us to remake this lazy minting / candy machine system. From the advanced revenue sharing, to 3XR VR galleries (with cool features like sound getting louder as you approach a music NFT), to the general quality of code from Mintbase's extended time in development of NFTs and indexers. We believe in your flexible approach to the technology that allows anyone to experiment with new NFT ideas.

#### Why Shardeez?

Tagline: Shardeez are "Sharded Blocks" on an eco-mission.

1. They look crazy cool. NEAR needs something like this.
2. Our team agreed on utility: an ecological mission. The Shardeez DAO will fund environmental projects.
3. Sharded blockchains are the future for settlement layers. Shardeez are their mascot.
4. We love our story and rarity trait formation. The 13 Clans are in groups of Eco-Defenders, Ecocidal Maniacs, and Degens. Each item has a Genesis Block, a Shardness Level, and a Clan. Each Clan has a King and Queen.

### Project Details

The first major milestone has three parts:

1. Smart Contracts: Mintbase.io contracts.
3. Bulk Arweave Uploads.
2. Mint Page: Frontend, Wallet, User, Pre-Mint Whitelist, Reveal, other functions.

Most of the work will be making a frontend that communicates with the smart contracts about the features of the NFT. We want to make a smooth and customizable experience that will be desired by anyone launching a collection on NEAR. Therefore, it will become a de-facto implementation; widely forked and repurposed. The first repurpose will be our second major milestone: a no-code launchpad.

#### Technology Stack:

- Frontend: TypeScript, React, Next.js
- Backend: (maybe for launchpad)
- Hosting: CloudFlare by default
- Smart Contracts: Mintbase API, NEAR SDKs, Rust,
- Storage: Arweave or IPFS

Note: bindings to smart contracts are on frontend.

#### What Bubblemint is Not

#### Data Models / API Specifications

-----------------------------
We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

- Mockups/designs of any UI components
- Data models / API specifications of the core functionality
- An overview of the technology stack to be used
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
  - This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious
-----------------------------

### Ecosystem Fit

-----------------------------
Help us locate your project in the Mintbase landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
- Who is your target audience (dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
- What need(s) does your project meet?
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem?
  - If so, how is your project different?
  - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?

## üóÉÔ∏è Team's experience üöß

Below are service delivery highlights, with some names obfuscated of not-yet-released work.

**Client A**

We built a smart contract education for a developer-incentivized blockchain. It‚Äôs a free interactive code school that teaches developers how to create their own CosmWasm contracts and deploy dApps to the network. This app trains devs on the Rust programming language.

**Renderz**

We built the backend and frontend of an NFT marketplace that is focused on anime-themed NFTs. The app is a full marketplace, where artists can create and mint NFTs, and sell them on the primary and secondary markets. We used ImmutableX, a zk-STARKS layer 2 of Ethereum for the source for minting and the secondary market provider.

**0x_Nodes**

A unique automated cross-chain yield aggregator. We built the interconnecting architecture for their liquidity terminal. This architecture was a transport layer for interactions between chains. This comprised of Solidity smart contracts and relayers via Node.js, TypeScript and Redis.

**Hummingbot Connectors**

Hummingbot is an open source algorithmic trading bot for CEXs and DEXs. We built connectors for clients that link Hummingbot's internal trading algorithms with live information from different exchanges. They interact with an exchange's REST API and through real-time interactions via Websockets; such as by gathering order book data and sending and canceling trades. We built connectors for speed in Python, Cython and AsyncIO. The projects we‚Äôve done:

- **IDEX**  ‚Äî connector for a hybrid liquidity platform with an off-chain order book + on-chain AMM
- **System9**  ‚Äî  a crypto market maker who needed an OSL Exchange connector.

**Umee.cc**

We built a beautiful dApp for a cross-chain DeFi hub for lending, borrowing, rates, staking, and interoperability. We built the frontend in React and managed many backend smart contracts and integrations. Our contracts are currently running on a Cosmos-based chain as well as Ethereum Goerli and Kovan testnets. The interface was recently featured on CoinBureau.

**Client B**

An on-chain game, modeled after a roulette wheel where bets are placed in BNB tokens on the Binance Smart Chain. For game logic, we used Chainlink VRF, and Chainlink Keepers for trustless spinning of the wheel. We used the Graph Protocol for indexed user information and Tailwind CSS Framework for the UI theme.

**UniTrade**

We built and designed an system to place limit orders on Uniswap v2. Our React + Web3.js front-end provided an intuitive, user-friendly interface that interacted with the Uniswap contracts and submitted orders to the server process for processing.

**Panvala**

We helped build a protocol for cryptocurrency donation-matching on L2s (Polygon and xDai) using React, EthersJS, Web3.js and Gatsby. This matching fund allows for small contributions with low fees and integrates to existing donation sites.

## Development Status :open_book:

Forking and customizing the TenK code. This will be completely re-written for Mintbase, but just to show our familiarity with the system needed. Original Repos:

1. https://github.com/TENK-DAO/frontend-starter (AktaryTech added 29 commits to this on our own fork)
2. https://github.com/TENK-DAO/tenk (AktaryTech added 32 commits to this on our own fork)

Example of some of our development on the projects, and how we reference JIRA tickets (SHARD-xx) to manage work.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Mintbase. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ‚âà 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**
